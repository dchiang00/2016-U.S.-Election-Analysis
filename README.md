# 2016-U.S.-Election-Analysis
With the 2020 election in the United States coming up in the Fall, I wanted to gain a better understanding of voting demographics and find evidence for certain patterns and trends. Specifically, I will analyze the relationship between percentage of votes for democrats and various state-related demographics. From historical trends, we know that county population (a proxy for urban areas) is a strong indicator. But I will conduct regression analysis to find out if there are stronger indicators.
